# LLM-Powered Real-Time Zero Trust Network System with Ledger Storage

## Overview
This project implements a **Real-Time Zero Trust Network Security System** leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for intelligent access control and **ledger-based storage** for secure, immutable logging. Unlike traditional **ML-based Zero Trust** models, this system employs **LLM pipelines** to analyze network interactions in real time, generate dynamic access control rules, and detect anomalies based on contextual reasoning.

## Features
- **LLM-Powered Real-Time Access Control**: Uses LLMs to analyze live network transactions and dynamically generate firewall policies.
- **Real-Time Ledger-Based Storage**: Immutable storage of access logs for immediate transparency, auditability, and forensic analysis.
- **Context-Aware Security**: Moves beyond pattern-based anomaly detection to intent-based real-time threat prevention.
- **Automated Rule Generation**: Synthesizes security policies based on real-time network behavior and ongoing interactions.
- **Continuous Network Monitoring**: Detects and mitigates unauthorized access attempts and potential breaches in real time.

## Technology Stack
- **LLMs**: GPT, BERT, or domain-specific transformer models for analyzing real-time network logs.
- **Blockchain/Ledger Storage**: Hyperledger, Ethereum, or Tendermint for immediate and immutable security logs.
- **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**: OpenFlow-based SDN controller for dynamic rule enforcement.
- **Datastores**: Redis, Apache Kafka, or other real-time NoSQL solutions for efficient data handling.
- **Containerization**: Docker & Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana for real-time analytics and alerting.

## System Architecture
1. **Real-Time Data Collection**
   - Captures live network traffic and system logs.
   - Extracts protocol details, metadata, and user interactions as they occur.

2. **LLM-Based Real-Time Rule Generation**
   - Analyzes communication patterns dynamically.
   - Suggests and enforces access policies based on ongoing network interactions.
   - Identifies anomalous behavior and potential threats in real time.

3. **Real-Time Ledger-Based Storage**
   - Instantly records transactions, authentication events, and policy changes in an immutable ledger.
   - Ensures immediate transparency and traceability.

4. **Real-Time Access Control Enforcement**
   - Deploys generated policies instantly to SDN controllers.
   - Continuously monitors and adjusts security rules based on live traffic changes.
